        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>About a year ago I graduated from Illinois State University with a B.S. in Business Information Systems.</p>
        <p>There I learned of many important technologies that I wanted to further study.</p>
        <p>Since graduation, I have been learning about cloud computing. I received a certificate in Azure, and I plan to pursue more. </p>
        <p>I have been studying the materials for the CompTIA Security+ certification.</p>
        <p>I'm taking Compter Science classes part-time at Harper College. </p>
        <p>And I'm building software outside of school for self-improvement.</p>
