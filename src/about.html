      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        About a year ago I graduated from Illinois State University with a B.S.
        in Business Information Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        There I learned of many important technologies that I wanted to further
        study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since graduation, I have been learning about cloud computing. I received
        a certificate in Azure, and I plan to pursue more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been studying the materials for the CompTIA Security+
        certification.
      </p>
      <p>I'm taking Compter Science classes part-time at Harper College.</p>
      <p>And I'm building software outside of school for self-improvement.</p>
